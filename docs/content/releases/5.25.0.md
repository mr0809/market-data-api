**New Features**

* Updated logic to explicitly assign the `Profile.asset` property for `AssetClass.CMDTY_STATS` instruments. 

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed `utilities/format/quote` function, preventing an error from being thrown when (a) the output `timezone` is specified, however (b) the `quote` does not have a `timeUtc` attribute.
* Fixed `AssetClass.parse` function.
