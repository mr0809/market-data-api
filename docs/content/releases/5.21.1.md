**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed issue which caused triggered the callback for a level one market data subscription to be triggered by a cumulative volume update. In other words, the [`MarketUpdateCallabck`](https://docs.barchart.com/marketdata-api-js/#/content/sdk/lib-connection?id=callbacksmarktupdatecallback) subscription handler (passed to the [`Connection.on`](https://docs.barchart.com/marketdata-api-js/#/content/sdk/lib-connection?id=connectionon) function) will no longer receive `REFRESH_CUMULATIVE_VOLUME` messages.
